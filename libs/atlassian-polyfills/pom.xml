        Provide classes which exist in some versions of the host product as 'provided'.

        For example, &#64;StrutsParameter was introduced in C8.5.6, and &#64;RequestMethod in Jira 9.0,
        but, by compiling against them, we're able to produce a binary that works with lower
        versions of Jira and Confluence, and that matches those annotations when executed in
        higher versions of C/J.
